  abstract = {An introductory text on the theory of numerical
                  analysis. Topics include: solutions of equations in one
                  variable; interpolations and polynomial approximation;
                  numerical differentiation and integration; initial value
                  problems for ordinary differential equations; direct methods
                  for solving linear systems; iterative techniques in matrix
                  algebra; approximation theory; approximating eigenvalues;
                  numerical solutions of non-linear systems of equations;
                  boundary-value problems for ordinary differential equations
                  and numerical solutions to partial differential equations. A
                  bibliography and answers to selected problems are also
                  included.},
